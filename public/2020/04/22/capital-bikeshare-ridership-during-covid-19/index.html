<p>The data world seems to be focused on making models using COVID-19 cases and deaths. However, since April 1st, I’ve been anxious to get the March 2020 Capital Bikeshare data to see how COVID-19 has affected the use of the District of Columbia’s public bikeshare system. I’ve come to terms with my emerging <a href="https://www.good.is/articles/foamer">“foamer”</a> status.</p>
<p>Open data from <a href="https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/">Capital Bikeshare</a> is available <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/capitalbikeshare-data/index.html">here</a>. For this analysis, I compare March 2018, March 2019, and March 2020 data using trips that either start or end in the District of Columbia. Trips starting or ending in DC account for 95 percent of system trips for these three months. I also use the <a href="https://gbfs.capitalbikeshare.com/gbfs/gbfs.json">API</a> for station information.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Station Location --------------------------------------------------------

<p>Let’s stick with the basics - how many trips were taken in March 2020 compared to March 2018 or March 2019? At first glance, ridership has dropped but not in the extreme numbers we’d expect from the majority of the city staying home.</p>

<h2>Comparison by week</h2>
<p>However, comparing by week shows the drastic changes in Week 12 and 13. In 2019, over 70,000 trips were taken in the last week of March. In 2020, that dropped 80 percent to not even 15,000 trips.</p>
<p><em>Fun fact: week numbers are sometimes called CDC weeks because counting weeks in the year originates from epidemiology… The Baader-Meinhof phenomenon is real.</em></p>
<p>Mayor Muriel Bowser issued the first restrictions on mass gatherings of 250 people or more on Friday, March 13, the end of Week 11. By Friday, March 20, the restrictions tightened to 50 people or more. On Thursday, March 26, Mayor Bowser ordered all non-essential businesses to close. Some riders continued to use Capital Bikeshare through these two weeks, but most reasons to bike for transportation were going away.</p>

<p>Throughout Week 12 and 13, there were still activities that attracted ridership, including the cherry blossom peak bloom at the Tidal Basin. What happens if we look at Tuesday - Thursday as a proxy for the “commuting week?” (This is transportation planners’ favorite approach to look at travel patterns for jobs.)</p>
<p>There’s an even starker difference between the last two weeks of March in 2020 versus 2019. Besides COVID-19-related dips in ridership, the third week of March in 2018 also experienced a dip. Additional analysis using National Weather Service data shows there was 3 inches of snow that week.</p>

<h2>Popular Stations during Social Distancing</h2>
<p>With non-essential businesses closed, where were people headed on Capital Bikeshare bikes? I ranked destination stations by their Week 13 ridership, looking for the (relative) winners in the era of social distancing. Stations near grocery stores were 5 of the top 10, and arguably 2 more could count as within the radius of grocery stores (New Hampshire &amp; T NW for the Soviet Safeway and 15th and W NW for the U Street Trader Joe’s). Many of these stations were highly ranked earlier in the month, which makes sense as they’re in locations filled with residents and businesses. But some stations are “having their moment”, such as 1st &amp; M NE (Harris Teeter in NoMa) and 8th &amp; O NW (Giant in Shaw).</p>
<p>The other three stations were National Mall stations, which are historically the top stations.</p>
