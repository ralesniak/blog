I'm **Rachel Lesniak**, a data analyst specializing in the nexus of American transit data and reproducible analyses in R. I love talking about streamlining workflows and code review.

Besides transit and R, I like local DC politics [(#DCStatehood)](https://twitter.com/search?q=dcstatehood), biking, weight lifting, stationery, stamp collecting, and the music I listened to in high school (like everyone else).

This website's theme was forked from [@jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme](https://github.com/jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme) and modified by [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium). Additional CSS modifications made by me.
